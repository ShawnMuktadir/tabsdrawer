Flutter: How to make Flutter Side Drawer (Side Menu) work with Bottom Navigation Bar (Bottom Tab Bar)


There are a lot of tutorials and articles available for Flutter Drawer and Bottom Navigation Bar, but nothing shows a correct way to create an app that can open the same page from Drawer and Bottom Navigation Bar without losing each other.
Few will get confused " why we should call the same page from the drawer and from the bottom navigation ?". There are so many reasons and the "client requirements" or "UI requirements" can be the main reasons.
Please kindly note that this article assumes that you have basic knowledge of flutter, side drawers, and navigation bars. In case you are not familiar, you can refer to Flutter Docs, Side Drawer, and Bottom Navigation.


Cheers!!
